# Tailwind CSS - Missing Content Paths Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: the `content` array in your `tailwind.config.js` file might be missing file paths to your components and HTML files.

**Problem:**

Tailwind CSS uses the `content` array in your configuration file to scan your source code for class names. If the paths in this array are incorrect or missing, Tailwind won't find your classes, resulting in styles not being applied.

**Solution:**

Ensure that your `content` array includes the correct paths to all your HTML files and components where you use Tailwind CSS classes.  Use glob patterns to include multiple files efficiently.  The solution file demonstrates this fix.
